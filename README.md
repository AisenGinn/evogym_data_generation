# Large Language Models as Natural Selector for Embodied Soft Robot Design

This project is built upon the [Evogym](https://github.com/evogym/evogym) framework to generate data using genetic algorithms. The generated data is utilized to create inputs for language models (LLMs), and the performance of various LLMs is evaluated through provided scripts.

## About Evogym

Evogym is a simulation environment for evolutionary robotics, enabling the design and testing of soft robots in diverse scenarios. This project leverages Evogym for data generation, forming the foundation of our experiments. For more details about Evogym, visit the [Evogym repository](https://github.com/evogym/evogym). 

## Installation
